# HerbControl - Main

This repository holds the Senior Project of the Herb Control group in Western Michigan University's CS4910 class. The repository contains the main components of the project. Each direcotry has its own README which will further explain the contents of that directory, as well as provide any necessary instructions to access, download or run any of the code.

# About The Project

The goal of this project was to develop a system for growing herbs, which has automated components. The system was designed to control lighting, measure soil moisture, air temperature and humidity, as well as provide access to this data and control of the components through a webpage. The herbs utilized were basil, parsley, mint and chives. The number of plants that can be sprouted and their long life lead to lower overall growing costs as seen here:
