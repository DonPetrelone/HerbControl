# HerbControl

The HerbController is a raspberry pi based system that alerts growers to the growing conditions of thier plants in real time and controls some of the gowing conditions automatically. It is based on the principles of energy efficiency and modularity. 

The HerbController is developped by a group of Western Michigan University undergraduates. It is under the GPL 2.0 open-source licence to encourage distribution and further development upon the system by others.
