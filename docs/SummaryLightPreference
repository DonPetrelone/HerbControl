Notes:

  Lights: Most sources say white. One dodgy source advocates red light for basil.
  -Parsley prefers red light supplementation for a few days before harvest (Seely)
  -Basil grows largest under 16% blue, has most flavor under 32% blue the rest being red (Seely)
  -Mint prefers red light to far red light. Is this useful? (Alsahli)
  -Chives; avoid incandescent bulbs (https://www.burpee.com/gardenadvicecenter/encyclopedia/herbs/learn-about-chives/encyclopedia__Chives-article.html)
  -ALL, sources say at least 6 hours
